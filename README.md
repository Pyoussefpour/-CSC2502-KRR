# CSC2502 – Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (Graduate Course)

This repository contains coursework and a paper presentation for **CSC2502: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning**, a graduate-level course in the Department of Computer Science at the **University of Toronto**.

## 📘 Course Overview

CSC2502 introduces the formal foundations and practical tools for representing knowledge and reasoning about it. The course explores logic-based knowledge representation systems and techniques used in artificial intelligence, automated planning, and semantic reasoning.

Key topics include:
- Propositional and First-Order Logic
- Default and Non-monotonic Reasoning
- Description Logics and Ontologies
- Autoepistemic and Circumscription Logics
- Resolution and Proof Strategies
- Knowledge Representation for Planning

## 📝 Assignment Summaries

### 🧠 Assignment 1 – Formal Logic and Reasoning
- Translated natural language puzzles into formal first-order logic (FOL).
- Constructed and proved logical equivalences and entailments using Horn clauses.
- Applied resolution to derive conclusions in geometry and equivalence-based reasoning.

### 🧩 Assignment 2 – Non-monotonic Reasoning
- Explored the limits of default logic, circumscription, and autoepistemic logic.
- Formalized defaults and exceptions using abnormality predicates.
- Compared weak vs. strong default representations and analyzed extensions under various logics.

### 🧮 Assignment 3 – Description Logics and Action Formalisms
- Designed TBoxes and ABoxes to model ontologies involving vehicles, parts, and agents.
- Reasoned about satisfiability and subsumption using DL axioms.
- Modeled planning problems using STRIPS operators, progression, and regression planning.
- Represented domain dynamics in both logical and STRIPS-based formalism.
